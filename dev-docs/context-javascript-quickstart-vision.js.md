# OpenAI Dev-Day Quickstart


## What's this:

OpenAi just had their dev day yesterday where they unveiled a couple things that you can instantly try in this interactive tutorial in a couple of minutes:

-GPT4 API with Vision
-Assistants(their answers to agents)
-Enforceable JSON mode to make it easier for developers to use the outputs in production code.

We are going to be trying all of these in a couple of minutes.

## Prereq: export your API Key


Before we start the quickstart export API_KEY

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR API KEY&gt;
```


## Run the first example for Vision:

The chatgpt API when set <code>gpt-4-vision-preview</code> can now explain images and do things with them.

Run the example to try it out:

```
node vision.js
```
